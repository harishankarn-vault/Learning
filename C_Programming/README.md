# Learning C Programming 💻

![](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1g4hiJDLZahpwkAj8JN7SampQmA290lwf)


Welcome to my C programming journey! This repository is dedicated to learning and exploring the C programming language. Here, you’ll find various code snippets, projects, and notes as I improve my skills in C.

## Getting Started 🚀

Whether you're just starting with C programming or looking to improve your skills, this repository contains examples and exercises aimed at helping you understand the basics and more advanced concepts.

### Why Learn C? 🤔

- **Low-level programming**: C allows you to work closely with the hardware and memory.
- **Fast execution**: C is known for its performance and is used in system-level programming.
- **Portable**: C code can be compiled on different platforms with minimal changes.
- **Foundation for other languages**: Many modern programming languages, like C++, Python, and Java, are influenced by C.

## Topics Covered 📝

Here’s a brief overview of the topics I’m focusing on:

- **Basics**: Variables, data types, operators, input/output.
- **Control Flow**: Conditionals (`if`, `else`, `switch`) and loops (`for`, `while`, `do-while`).
- **Functions**: Defining and using functions, recursion.
- **Pointers**: Memory management, pointer arithmetic.
- **Arrays and Strings**: Working with arrays, string manipulation.
- **Structures**: Defining and using `struct` for grouping variables.
- **File I/O**: Reading from and writing to files.

## The Famous `donut.c` 🍩

The **donut.c** program is a popular piece of C code that renders a rotating 3D donut in the terminal. It's a great example of how simple mathematical concepts can be applied in C to create visual effects.

### How to Run `donut.c` 🏃‍♂️

If you're new to C programming, here's a quick guide to compile and run the **donut.c** file:

#### 1. Clone the Repository
First, clone this repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/harishankarn04/learning-c.git
cd learning-c
```

#### 2. Compile and run the code
```
gcc -o donut donut.c -lm
./donut
```
