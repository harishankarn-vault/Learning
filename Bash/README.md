Welcome to my Bash scripting folder! Here, I'm documenting my journey as I learn and experiment with Bash scripting. Bash is a powerful scripting language for automating tasks in Unix-like operating systems.

## 🚀 Getting Started

This repository contains various scripts that I’m learning to write. Each script serves a specific purpose, allowing me to practice different Bash concepts and commands.

### Prerequisites

- A Unix-like operating system (Linux, macOS)
- Basic understanding of command-line operations
- Bash installed (usually pre-installed in most Unix systems)

## 📝 Learning Goals

1. Understand basic scripting syntax and structure.
2. Learn to use control structures (loops, conditionals).
3. Work with functions and variables.
4. Develop skills to handle file manipulation and process automation.
5. Create useful scripts that can aid in daily tasks.
